Ways to Punish  
𝟏. 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐏𝐎𝐖𝐄𝐑 𝐎𝐅 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐏𝐎𝐒𝐔𝐑𝐄  
Imagine a woman begins to ignore you. Your initial reaction may be frustration, but not behaving like a spoilt brat is critical. When you don't allow her to drag you into emotional outbursts, you keep your dignity. This maturity can show her that you are not easily swayed and may even inspire her to seek your attention more.  
  
𝟐. 𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐏 𝐏𝐔𝐓𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐎 𝐏𝐄𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐋  
When a girl ignores you, don't put her on a pedestal. You may think they're worth more than your self-esteem. You gotta recognize that your self-worth is vital.  
It's essential to develop a sense of self-superiority, i.e. to believe that no-one is superior to you and you are the final boss.  
  
𝐓𝐨 𝐬𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞, 𝐚 𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭.  
𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥.  
  
𝟑. 𝐀𝐕𝐎𝐈𝐃 𝐁𝐄𝐆𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐅𝐎𝐑 𝐀𝐓𝐓𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍  
Most men often make the mistake of begging for a woman's attention when she starts to ignore them. Actually, this reaction feeds her ego.  
Resist the urge to seek her validation at any given point. Not only does this change preserve your self-esteem, but it also makes her wonder why her actions aren't affecting you as intended.  
  
𝟒. 𝐒𝐇𝐎𝐖 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐄𝐌𝐎𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐄𝐍𝐆𝐓𝐇  
Showing emotional weakness when ignored can compromise your image as a man.  
Take control of your emotions and stay calm.  
This strength may make her regret her decision to ignore you.  
  
𝟓. 𝐈𝐆𝐍𝐎𝐑𝐄 𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐁𝐀𝐂𝐊  
It may seem counterintuitive, but ignoring her existence can be a powerful response from you.  
Many women seek attention, and when they don't get it, they become intrigued.  
By ignoring her in return, you show that you're not desperate for her approval.  
  
7 Signs Someone is into you:  
Sign #1:

Sign #2:  
She likes being alone with you  
If she likes being with you in a group, that's nothing. After all, being with equally attractive people in a group makes you look attractive as well.

Sign #4:  
Her friends tell you so  
To catch the fourth sign, listen to what her friends tell you—particularly when they say stuff like:  
  
“She's really into you, you know.”  
“She likes you. It’s so obvious.”  
“You’d better take good care of her  
  
Sign #5:  
She asks about your living arrangements
