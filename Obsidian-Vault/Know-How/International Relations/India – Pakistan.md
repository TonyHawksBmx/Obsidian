        - **Kashmir has a very heterogenetic character in regard due to the geography and culture and the whole state of Jammu and Kashmir can be treated as a conglomeration of these distinctive regions that is Jammu and Kashmir, Mountaneous Gilgit, Baltistan and Ladakh plateau.**
            
        - **These regions were brought under a United Political union unit by Maharaja Gulab Singh who entered into subsidiary alliance with the British. Thus Kashmir was ruled by Hindu ruler where majority of the population was Muslim.**
            
        - **After independence, statehood was sought by Pakistan on the basis of its Muslim majority. However, the ruler of Kashmir was not able to make up his mind and the desire to run independent and conclude that standstill agreement with both dominions, that is India and Pakistan.**
            
        - **However, in October 1947, fully armed tribesmen supported by Pakistan forces invaded Kashmir and the ruler of Kashmir made a desparate appeal to Indian government for military help. Indian government promised to help on the assurance that Kashmir will be ceded to Indian union. The ruler agreed to this condition. An instrument of accession was signed by Maharaja Hari Singh and Kashmir became legally and constitutionally a part of Indian Union.**
            
        - **Pakistan described the succession to be based on the fraud and deceit and violence. Since then, Pakistan has maintained that the step of India was totally against the wishes of its long oppressed Muslim subjects.**

Within a few months of the war, India decided to take the case to the UN and UN proposed a plebiscite.

        - **when the military general Pakistan Yaiya Khan refused to hand over the political power to the democratically elected leader of Eastern Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. Pakistani Army unleashed region of terror in Eastern Pakistan, thus pushed the Bengalis to crossover to India and Government of India protested against the situation and mobilized the world opinion against the dictatorial act of Pakistan.**

    - **The geopolitics of the region changed post 90s**
        
        - **with the disintegration of Soviet Union and US emerged as the sole superpower as Taliban came into power in the Afghan, Pakistan decided to wage a proxy war against India and Pakistan pushed the strategy of bleeding India through 1000 cuts.**

            - **such a rigid stand brought the summit to an unexpected end.**
                
        - **Terrorist attack on Parliament in 2001 again proved the fatality of peace negotiation. While for India terrorism continues to be the most important issue, Pakistan has claimed that Kashmir is the most prominent issue.**
            
        - **Because of these two divided perspectives, the dialogue process isn't deadlocked between the two.**
