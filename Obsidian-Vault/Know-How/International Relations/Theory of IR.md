**Theories of IR**

**Idealism**

**Realism**

**Liberalism**

  

**As per theory of Idealists:**

- **States thrive for Peace.**
    
- **Believe in cooperation.**
    
- **Do not prefer wars as wars are percieved as harmful.**
    
- **The reason for war is lack of understanding amongst the member states towards each others interests.**
    
- **If they are able to understand the interest of each other, they will cooperate and will try to maintain peace within the International System.**
    

**According the the Realists:**

- **Idealism overestimates the role of morality in Geopolitics and has neglected the role of power.**
    
- **As an instrument in State politics as the basic interest of every state is to survive, thus the core national interest of every state is to survive.**
    
- **Thus the core national interest of a nation is national security.**
    
- **Every state wants to have access to more resources**
    
- **This brings state into conflict with each other and this distributes the power equilibrium and wars become inevitable.**
    
- **Niccolai Macheaveli**
    

  

**According to Liberalists;**

- **States - merely an instrument of war, do not co-operate with each other.**
    
- **Cooperation - to ensure the welfare of the people,otherwise impossible if in the continuous state of warfare and instability.**
    
- **Thus as states become more independent and a situation of conflict arises.**
    
    - **Resolution of disputes peacefully and not opt for war.**
        
    - **As war will hinder interest of people in the states.**
        
    - **Thus as cooperation will increase ;the chances of war/conflict will reduce.**
        

**According to Pragmatism;**

- **Whatever helps in furthering your self interests and avoids conflict but not looking always for the best interest for the other.**
    
- **Post Enlightenment era – Modern states.**


**Liberalism as a school of thought is further divided into 2 school of Thoughts:**

- **Republican Liberalism**
    
    - **Democracy can create a peaceful global environment as democratic societies are more transparent and are based on the rue of Law.**
        
    - **Do democracies fight wars?**
        
        - **No, they do not fight war amongst themselves but they do see dictatorial regimes as a threat for world peace as these regimes do not work acc to rule of law.**
            
        - **They curb fundamental freedoms and are threat for world peace.**
            
        - **So democracies resort to replace these dictatorial regimes with parties who are pro democracy.**
            
        - **But sometime they replace them with puppet govt’s which may lead to more conflict, unrest and instability in the region.**
            

  

- **Social Liberalism**
    
    - **States that the study of IR should not be restricted tot the study of nations states as multiple actors interact and cooperate within the state.**
        
    - **In the era of globalisation, the interaction b/w the states takes place through multiple trans-national actors or non state actors.**
        
    - **It is through the ability to attract and cooperate rather than by coercion (hard power) which is using force or giving money as means of persuasion.**
        
    - **Soft power is the ability to shape the preference of others through appeal and attraction.**
        
    - **A definite feature of Soft Power is that it is coercive.**
        
    - **The currency of soft power is Culture.**
        
        - **Political Views**
            
        - **Foreign Policies**
            
    - **It is the ability to influence behavior of other to get the outcomes you want.**
        
    - **It can be contrasted with ‘hard power’ which is the use of coercion.**
        

  

**Seduction is always more effective than coercion and many values like democracy, human rights and individual opportunities are deeply seductive.**
