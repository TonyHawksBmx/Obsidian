- **This is called as the cold war because both the sides never fought directly in the War.**
    
- **All the wars were fought amongst the the 3rd world countries.**
    
- **During the war the world was divided into 2 blocs,**
    
    - **Communist bloc led by USSR,**
        
    - **Capitalist bloc led by US.**
        
- **Factors which led to the Cold War.**

    - **The leaders of the capitalist countries feared the communists, and they feared the domino effect for communism whereby when 1 country was allowed to become communist, then the neighboring country would soon follow the suit or the similar pattern, thus threatening capitalism and democracy.**
        
        - **It was the fear of the domino effect that forced the US participation in the Vietnam War.**
            
        - **As after China and North Korea, turning of Vietnam into a communist state would have had put Japan under the threat of communism, where US had put a lot of aid and money after the World War 2 to make Japan a capitalist flourishing economy in the region.**

- **Stalin denounced the Martial Plan of US as dollar imperialism devised to increase the influence of Western Europe and interfere in the Soviet sphere of influence.**
    
- **As per post revisionist view, Both the superpowers failed to develop the mutual trust and due to high mutual suspicion any action of one side was viewed as having an aggressive intent by the other.**

- **NPT and CTBT are the two treaties which are the steps taken by United Nations for global nuclear disarmament and India has made it clear multiple times that it will join only only a universal, comprehensive, non discriminatory treaty aiming for a nuke free world.**
    
- **Some of the major oppositions of India towards NPT are**
    
    - **NPT puts different sets of obligation on the nuclear weapon States and a non nuclear weapon state.**
        
        - **It defines P5 as a nuclear weapon state where all other countries in the world are tagged as non nuclear weapon state.**
            
        - **According to NPT, non nuclear weapon state cannot acquire nuclear weapon and they will be prevented to acquire them even under the exceptional security reasons.**
            
    - **Also according to NPT, non nuclear weapon states have to put their installations under IAEA that is International Atomic Energy.**
        
        - **On the contrary, NPT relieves nuclear weapons shades from both these obligations.**
            
    - **India views these provisions as discriminatory.**
        
        - **India argues that this treaty only prevents the spread of nuclear technology rather than fulfilling the objective of global disarmament.**
            
        - **The single objects that there is a mismatch between its proclaimed objective and its actual intentions.**
            
        - **As the preamble of NPT itself talks about complete disarmament.**
            
    - **India has also questioned the effectiveness of NPT**
        
        - **as according to India, NPT has failed to check the horizontal proliferation.**
            
        - **As nuclear know how has proliferated to countries like Libya, Iran, North Korea through backdoor channels,**
            
    - **India has raised concern about the date line that is 1967 which legitimizes the position of nuclear weapons state that is P5.**
        
        - **AS, according to NPT, those who acquired nuclear weapons by 1967 are legitimate nuclear weapons states.**
            
    - **Also, according to India, NPT does not take into account the specific circumstances that compel a country to go for nuclear weapon testing.**
        
        - **The classic example was China, Pakistan, US Nexus during the 70s that compelled/pushed India to go for nuclear weapon testing in the 74 to acquire nuclear deterrence.**
            
    - **According to India, NPT has also does not stand for any time bound disarmament.**
        
    - **India's main concern at present is that after the NSG waiver of 2008, India is being recognized as a responsible nuclear state. So it cannot join NPT as a non nuclear weapon state.**
        
    - **India's prime concern is that the dateline that divides nuclear weapons stage from a non nuclear weapon states.**
        
    - **In a recent statement given in Parliament by Indian Prime Minister, there is no question of India joining NPT as a nuclear weapon state and nuclear weapons are an integral part of India's national security and will remain so.**
        
- **India's main opposition to CTBT.**
    
    - **India opposes CTBT also as according to India, CTBT is also discriminatory as it legitimizes the possession of nuclear weapons by few countries. And CTBT allows them to retain and improve these weapons indefinitely, as CTBT only bans the testing of nuclear weapons on land or surface, underground, underwater, whether sea or oceans or atmosphere. However, CTPT has not banned the laboratory testing through computer simulation techniques in which P5 has acquired the expertise and according to India, this shows the hegemony of the P5 countries.**
        
- **India's track record on issue of global nuclear disarmament.**
    
    - **Indias criticism towards NPT and CTBT are not empty or void as India has shown enough credentials in the past to prove with seriousness towards the objective of global disarmament.**
        
    - **Since independence, India stood for the peaceful use of nuclear technology and India acquired nuclear capability in 1974 to acquire nuclear deterrent and India exercised an unparalleled restraint and not weaponizing its nuclear capability.**
        
    - **India decided to weaponize its capability in 1998 as Pakistan wanted to aquire nuclear weapon and India declared that India will be going to maintain a minimum credible nuclear deterrence and India will not engage in any nuclear arms race.**
        
    - **Also, India decided to announce voluntarily a no first use nuclear doctrine and India believes that the global no first use agreement could be the first step towards de-legitimization of nuclear weapons.**
        
    - **After the test of 1998, India announced self-imposed moratorium until the situation demands.**
