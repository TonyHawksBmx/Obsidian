- College students made to perform
	- obviously boring and tedious tasks
	- Students divided into 2 groups
		- group 1 - 20$ each
		- group 2 - 1$ each
	- Asked to lie to students outside, that task was interesting
	- After 3 days made to reveal their true attitude towards the task
		- group 1 - dislike
		- group 2 - like (dissonance caused attitude change)
- This explains the phenomenon of escalations of efforts.
