Hinduism is an Atheism(Science) and a theism at the same time

How?

"Long story short "

  

Universe (Brahmand) consists of 4 things

1. Param atma (Energy)

2. Param tatva (Matter)

3. Maha kal (Time )

4. Kal (Black space)

  

(Today Science says

Space and Time are not different they are different attributes of 1 thing and Hindus use 1 word "Kal")

  

1. Param Atma

2. Param tatva

Both are Param (Supreme)

Hence equal

Atma = Tatva

Energy = Matter

E = M

E = MC2 (After Solar formation)

  

Both are Immortal

Both can not be created nor destroyed only translated ( or incarnated) into another form (or body )

  

Both are Trinity

Energy has trinity aspects

1. Creation +ve

2. Preservaton =

3. Destruction -ve

  

Matter has trinity aspects

1. Proton +ve

2. Neutron =

3. Electron -ve

  

Hindus personified it as

Brahma +ve

Vishnu =

Shiva -ve

  

(Anu Anu me Vishnu Vishnu hai

Kankar Kankar me shankar shankar hai)

Since Energy and matter are two

2 types of worship

1. Meditation (Yog-Connection between atma and param atma )

2. Idol worshipping (Param tatva)

  

Why idol worshipping?

Hindus do the same rituals on the purchase of car bike house TV AC etc which we do before idols

Bcoz

A car can be moulded into an Idol of Natraja

But no change in the composition of the proton neutron electron

So Hindus are not idol worshiper

Hindus worship the entire spread of the Universe as cosmic form of Lord Krsna(Brahm)

And

Singularity as Shivling (scroll )

  

Functions of Param tatva

1. Proton and neutron are always connected form Nucleous

Brahma and Vishnu are also always connected through navel cord (Nabhi)

Nucleous Hindi name is also "Nabhi"

1. Electrons always revolve in its ring

Depicted as

Shiva's dance in the ring of fire

  

Functions of Param Atma

1. Preservation

Vishnu the personification of preservative aspect of the Universe energy

Or

Simply

Vishnu the preserver

1st avatar of Vishnu was Fish

2nd Avatar of Vishnu was Turtle

Now in last 150 years

Science said the same how life evolved and preservered on Earth

  

1. Creation

Universe born out of nothingness(0) and will merge back to nothingness(0)

  

Nothingness is represented by 0 given by AryaBhat

0 is an ellipsoide shaped Shivling which banged and infinity came into being

1,0000000000000000......

And

The Universe

  

1. Destruction

Since Universe born out of nothingness(0) and will merge back to nothingness(0)

  

Shivling is the source of creation as well as destruction

  

Shivling (0)has 2 functions

So

2 types of worships

1. Creation (0) -Inner consiousness

2. Destruction (0) - surrounded by a ring

  

3. Creation (0)

Pouring water on Shivling and placing shivling near water bodies symbol of cooling down it's energies so that it wont bang

  

2.Destruction (0)

Bhasm Arti - raining down of human ashes on shivling shows destruction of human

  

Now Science says there is a destructible energy Black hole and same way it destroys planets into dust

  

Now String theory looked into quarks and found out vibrations at different frequencies

These Vibrations are nothing but Eco of Om(Omkar)

[https://youtu.be/8sYK7lm3UKg](https://youtu.be/8sYK7lm3UKg)

All Trinity principles start with vibration Om

1. Om namo Brahma

2. Om Namo Narayanai (Vishnu)

3. Om Namah Shivay

All Hindu prayers start with OM

Omkar(Eco of Om) represents start of the Universe

So

Param atma + Param tatva + Maha kal + Kal = Universe (Brahm or Brahmand)

  

The highest manifestion of Brahm is Para Brahm

Multi Universe

  

Crux

In Vedas

It's written

Worship both

1. Sambhuti (Matter)

2. Asambhuti (Energy)

Otherwise you will go into darkness

  

  

While we only worship Param tatva (Matter) not Param atma (Energy)

So

Do Meditation for 1 hour every day with chanting Om

It rejuvenates ur body and soul

  

All sages did meditation,

Ravan did meditation ,

Lord Buddha did meditation to empower themselve
