MEASUREMENT

- Measurement is the act of determining an object.
    
- Size, length, weight, capacity or other features is the basis of all important scientific studies.
    
- Measurement can also be stated as the determination of the size of the magnitude of a quantity and is considered as a cornerstone of trade science, technology and quantitative research in various discipline.
    
- Physical quantities.
    
    - Physical quantity can be classified into two types, fundamental quantity and derived quantity.
        
    - Quantities which cannot be expressed in terms of any other physical quantities are called fundamental quantities, example of which are length, mass, time, temperature etc.
        
    - Quantities which are calculated from two or more measurements are called derived quantities. Example are area, volume, density, etc.
        
    - Physical quantities have a numerical value and a unit of measurement.
        
- Units.
    
    - A unit is a standard quantity which unknown quantities are compared to, just defined as scientific magnitude of a physical quantity that has been adopted by a law or convention.
        
    - For example, feet is the unit of measuring length. That means, 10 feet is equal to 10 times the definite predetermined length called feet.
        
    - In earlier time, different unit systems were used by different people in different countries. They are defined as follows.
        
        - The cgs system, centimeter, gram, second
            
        - the FPS system, Foot, Pound, Second
            
        - the MKS system. Meter, Kilogram, Second
            
        - But at the end of the Second World War, there was a necessity to use worldwide system of measurement, hence the SI, that is, the International System of units, was developed and recommended by the general conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 for international usage.
            
- SI system of Units
    
    - The SI system of units is the modernized and improved form of the previous system of units.
        
    - It is accepted in almost all the countries of the world. It is based on a certain set of fundamental units from which derived units are obtained by multiplication or division.
        
    - fundamental physical quantities in their units fundamental quantities.

            - 1m is the distance traveled by light through vacuum in 1/1,299,792,458 Second
                
        - In order to measure very large distances( distance of astronomical objects), the following units are used.
            
            - Light year
                
                - This is the distance traveled by light in one year in vacuum.
                    
                - It is equal to 9.46 x 1015 m.
                    
                    - light travels 3 x108ms-1 or 3,00,000 kms-1.
                        
                    - The total number of seconds in one year = 365x24x60x60s= 3.153 x 107 s.

- Unit Prefixes
    
    - Unit prefixes are the symbols placed before the symbol of a unit to specify the order of magnitude of a quantity.
        
    - They are useful to express very large or very small quantities.
        
    - Kilo is a unique prefix in the unit kilometer.
        
    - Unit prefix stands for a specific positive or negative power of 10.

- Rules and conversion for working SI and their symbols,
    
    - The unit names or scientists are not written with the capital initial letters example, newton, henry, ampere, and watt.
        
    - The symbol of units named after scientists should be written by the initial capital letter example N for newton, H for henry, A for ampere, and W for watt
        
    - Small letters are used as symbols for units not derived from a proper noun. eg. m for meter, kg for kilogram.
        
    - No full stop or other punctuation should be induced within or at the end of the symbol.
        
    - The symbols of the units are not expressed in plural form.
        
    - When temperature is expressed in Kelvin, the degree sign is omitted.
        
    - Use of Solidus / is recommended only for division of one letter unit symbol by another unit symbol. Not more than one solidus is used. Example ms-1 not m/s.
        
    - The number in unit should be separated by a space
        
    - Accepted symbols alone should only be used.
        
    - The numerical values of physical quantity should be written in scientific form.
        
- Vernier Calliper
    
    - The smallest length which can be measured by a meter scale is called least count.
        
    - In meter scale, the measurements are calibrated in centimeter and millimeter.
        
    - Usually the least count of scale is 1mm.
        
    - However, in order to measure the objects with more accuracy, for vernier caliper and screw gauges are used.
        
    - Accuracy of Vernier caliper is 0.1 MM.
        
    - Pierre Vernier.
        
        - Who was living from 1580 to 1637, was a French government official and he was interested on cartography and surveying.
            
        - This led to the invention of precise instrument called vernier caliper.
            
    - Working a vernier caliper
        
        - The first step in using the Vernier caliper is to find out the least count, range and zero error.
            
        - least count of the instrument = value of 1 smallest main scale division/total number of vernier scale divisions.
            
            - The main scale division will be centimeter, further divided into millimeter.
                
                - The value of the smallest main scale division is 1mm.
                    
            - The Vernier scale division is obtained by counting number of divisions in it.
                
                - In the vernier scale there will be 10 divisions.
                    
            - Thus lease count is equal to 1mm upon 10 which is equal to 0.1 millimeter which is equal to 0.01 centimeter.
                
        - If the 0 marking of the main scale coincides with that of the 0 marking of the Vernier scale, then it is said to have a 0 error. If it is not, then the instrument is having 0 error.
            
            - Positive Zero error.
                
                - The zero of the vernier scale is located to the right of the side of the zero of the mean scale.
                    
                - In this case the reading will be more than the actual reading and this is the error should be corrected to get the accurate measurement.
                    
                - In order to correct this error it is important to find out which one of the division is coinciding with any of the main scale division.
                    
                    - It is evident from the diagram that the 5th Vernier division is coinciding with a main scale division.
                        
                    - So positive error is equal to 5 * least count = 0.05cm
                        
                    - and the zero correction is negative.
                        
                    - The zero correction here is 0.05 centimeter.
                        
            - Negative Zero Error
                
                - If is zero of the Vernier scale is located to the left side of the zero of the main scale
                    
                - Here the obtained reading will be less than the actual reading.
                    
                    - In this case from the diagram just shown that the 6th line is coinciding with the main scale division
                        
                    - In order to find out the negative whether it must be counted backwards. That is from 10.
                        
                    - Here the fourth line is coinciding so
                        
                    - negative error is -4 * 0.01 = - 0.04 cm.
                        
                    - Zero correction is positive. The zero correction is -0.04 cm
                        
    - Use of a Vernier Calliper
        
        - Used to find the different dimensions of any familiar objects
            
        - Can calculate the volume of an object if the length, breadth and height are known.
