10/15/21, 2:12 PM - Simi Raus: I won’t. With my friend Shireen for the ‘fun weekend’ remember 
10/15/21, 2:12 PM - Simi Raus: I won’t disturb you abhi. We can talk ache se when you’re back if you want. 
10/15/21, 4:13 PM - Simi Raus: Is that fine with you? 
10/15/21, 8:46 PM - Sumit Kumar: I said what i had to say simi. 10/15/21, 8:47 PM - Sumit Kumar: I hope you too can find your peace with me. 
10/16/21, 11:46 PM - Simi Raus: It’s not something I chose to do. In my message, I mentioned about trying to shrug it off every time as nothing. It happened on its own. I never tried to do that. 
10/16/21, 11:48 PM - Simi Raus: I hope you give a call/message/ meet when you’re back. I’m leaving that open for you ‘cause I have a feeling that I need to/should so that you can if/when you want to. 
10/16/21, 11:48 PM - Simi Raus: Waiting for this message 
10/16/21, 11:49 PM - Simi Raus: I have that feeling. Wasn’t trying deliberately 
10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: You can give a call when you can or take one of my calls or do a call back. I would like that. A break up/such conversation over text is how you know. Respect my feelings over here thoda. We’ve given each other enough time amid energy to warrant that at least I think don’t you think. 
10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: I’ll be waiting for a call. Good night. Sleep well. 
10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: 🌷 
10/16/21, 11:52 PM - Simi Raus: Please don’t be mean or sound so mean like that. It hurts you know. I’m human. And then later you also hurt/feel guilty knowing how it hurt me. 
10/16/21, 11:56 PM - Simi Raus: I’ve learnt from the past here. So I’m doing that :) 
10/16/21, 11:58 PM - Simi Raus: Don’t talk like you hate/dislike me when you don’t. It can really do a number on the other person you know. It’s the shittiest feeling. 
10/16/21, 11:58 PM - Simi Raus: Anyway goodnight. Hoping to hear from you. I mean it 🌹 
10/17/21, 4:08 AM - Simi Raus: Don’t blame me when I didn’t try to do anything. I can’t control something like my intuition like that. I had no control over it. 10/17/21, 4:19 AM - Simi Raus: That cannot be the reason 
10/17/21, 4:24 AM - Simi Raus: Please sometimes try to understand my side and feelings a little also. Don’t just readily put blame like that. That’s just…. 
10/17/21, 4:46 AM - Simi Raus: Is it really that easy for you to say that? 
10/17/21, 5:07 AM - Simi Raus: The things you say to be sometimes, they’re way too harsh. Do they come that easy to you kya without any consideration of how I could feel. Do I deserve no regard for my feelings? 10/17/21, 5:09 AM - Simi Raus: or just in general any kind of regard in your life? 10/17/21, 11:17 AM - Simi Raus: Like you don’t care kya how any of this I’m handling or how I could feel. Don’t you feel like even checking up? 
10/17/21, 11:17 AM - Simi Raus: I’m sincerely not trying to get you angry or riled up. It’s just difficult to process I’m sorry 
10/17/21, 11:23 AM - Simi Raus: Would feel really nice to me. 
10/17/21, 11:54 AM - Simi Raus: I can’t just shut you out aggressively like this Sumit. Somewhere I genuinely feel that I shouldn’t, that I should keep lines of communication open still. I’m doing that. For the sake of the happy times last month that we spent with each other. That deserves better than a text thread and such messages. Please Sumit I’ve always considered and being patient with your feelings and emotions and wants, couldn’t you be once. I know you are not trying to be rude, and that trying things are going on at your end, but somewhere you know what I’m saying has truth to it. Please reach out(must’ve said that a 100 times by now I think. Please don’t make be beg like I have no shame at all) ❤️ 
10/17/21, 12:09 PM - Simi Raus: I would really like to talk to you and see you when I can ♥️ 
10/17/21, 12:18 PM - Simi Raus: I know you care even when you seemed like you don’t. But it’s just hard to see that side. I hope you understand that 🌻 
10/18/21, 1:27 AM - Simi Raus: I really miss you 🤍
