I think i have embarassed myself beyond the point of return on this relationship. I really did intend just the good for the both of us. But i think sometimes its not just the intention but also the actions that one needs to take on into consideration. You have been a good person. Apologies for my rude behaviour or short temperedness. I cannot return what time may have been lost because of me. But i think it would be in the best of my interests to take my distance from you at this present moment. I dont have anymore answers to your questions. Goodluck. 17/10/22, 7:16 pm - Sumit Kumar: Godspeed. 17/10/22, 7:18 pm - Simi Baruah: I was just thinking of messaging you. You did not embarrassed me Sumit. You only tried to love me and show love to me over this weekend. And I may been a fool to understand it. I stretched you too far beyond what you can give and not seeing what you did. 17/10/22, 7:24 pm - Simi Baruah: I didn’t consider how exhausted you could’ve been over the past few weeks of shifting,traveling, exams and lack of sleep. Still you did everything in your capacity to show me your love. And I think I may have disrespected you my asking way too much; not taking into consideration you at many times. I do see it. Sorry. I wish I could do a do over of all this. Shows me how I need to more than what I say. Please 🦒 I’m also sorry for my demands of the past few days. You were so sweet to come and visit and I ruined it too. 17/10/22, 7:26 pm - Simi Baruah: I kept looking at your faults and failed to see mine. Please give me a chance to make amends. 17/10/22, 7:27 pm - Simi Baruah: I can’t loose you. You are precious to me(and I shouldn’t have taken that for granted). 17/10/22, 7:29 pm - Simi Baruah: Like I’d said too, life will be meaningless without you. That’s why I love you. 17/10/22, 7:30 pm - Simi Baruah: Please show some faith and trust. I really need that. Maybe we both. 17/10/22, 7:31 pm - Simi Baruah: Tere bina nahi hoga re.

But I’m too scared to loose you man. I don’t know what to do otherwise 17/10/22, 7:46 pm - Simi Baruah: Sumit…. 17/10/22, 7:51 pm - Simi Baruah: Tu bura nahi tha. I had been too much to handle. Apna maan ke ek baar please baat kar le. We are more than yesterday. And we have been crossed far greater hurdles together. Your love is everything to me 🤍 17/10/22, 8:10 pm - Simi Baruah: I think I drove you away this time. Please help me fix it. I fucked up. 17/10/22, 8:56 pm - Simi Baruah: You keep taking the blame that you don’t know how to be in a relationship. I also blame you (too)often. Didn’t see how I too can be the same. 17/10/22, 8:56 pm - Simi Baruah: I’m sorry 17/10/22, 9:01 pm - Simi Baruah: I know I needed to learn a lesson.

And in my exercise of that i feel i may end up being unfair to you. you present me with ideas which i don't want in my life, which i have been trying to avoid myself for it limits my growth in life. I cannot validate survival on giveaways or taking things which i haven't worked for. 18/10/22, 7:49 pm - Sumit Kumar: I know it all may seem complicated to you. 18/10/22, 7:49 pm - Sumit Kumar: But i cannot explain anymore, or take your word when you say you understand. 18/10/22, 7:50 pm - Simi Baruah: You don’t have to take my word. I’ve slipped but I do care to understand. And that’s not unfair on me 18/10/22, 7:50 pm - Sumit Kumar: It's bot you shayad i have given up on.

I was just speaking the way I reply to you face to face 18/10/22, 7:57 pm - Sumit Kumar: I think its the best for me to not be there with you at this point. 18/10/22, 7:58 pm - Simi Baruah: I need your company. It’s the most valuable one in my life. You have been my confidant 18/10/22, 8:00 pm - Simi Baruah: This message was deleted 18/10/22, 8:06 pm - Simi Baruah: I don’t have anything legit besides that I love you. A lot.

I don't know how to look out for my self interests in them. 18/10/22, 8:35 pm - Sumit Kumar: You deleted this message 18/10/22, 8:55 pm - Simi Baruah: Well you are the person I am the closest to. I have shared the most of and about myself to you. You know every good and bad thing about me. You’ve seen me at my most vulnerable and have given me strength. You’ve alway encouraged me to be strong. By default, you’re my best friend 🦒👻 18/10/22, 9:16 pm - Sumit Kumar: I am sorry for taking my liberties with you, i should've not promised anything without knowing the scenarios those promises would be put to test against. I made a mistake simi. Hope you can forgive me for this. 18/10/22, 9:17 pm - Simi Baruah: You didn’t make any mistake re baba. You gave me a beautiful friendship; one I didn’t know could even exist🥲 18/10/22, 9:18 pm - Sumit Kumar: I have not been able to understand or explain my needs to you. So i cant even be mad at you for not being able to ggive me what i need. 18/10/22, 9:18 pm - Simi Baruah: I should’ve tried harder. For my friendship’s sake 😭 18/10/22, 9:18 pm - Sumit Kumar: But please do understand it dude. I don't want a relationship rright now in my life of all things. 18/10/22, 9:19 pm - Simi Baruah: Shut up dude.

And don’t be 18/10/22, 9:24 pm - Sumit Kumar: I won't be able to give flight to my dreams otherwise. 18/10/22, 9:25 pm - Simi Baruah: You and I are not world’s apart like you’ve said. We are not. We are both simple people who want a simple life. And to follow our dreams 18/10/22, 9:26 pm - Simi Baruah: You are always giving flight/wings to your dreams whether I’m there or not. 18/10/22, 9:26 pm - Simi Baruah: Aur tere dreams mere liye bhi previous hain yaar 18/10/22, 9:26 pm - Simi Baruah: Aur khudke bhi(before you mention 😛) 18/10/22, 9:29 pm - Simi Baruah: You are passionate about your dreams and family. I’ll never take that place. You didn’t fail to say that even when you were drunk that day. 😂 You mentioned how you love and respect me but your dreams and family are your first priority. I’ll always be supportive of that 🤍 18/10/22, 9:30 pm - Simi Baruah: You’ve always maintained that.

But it’s not about me being okay with it, I am telling you I respect that 19/10/22, 10:08 pm - Simi Baruah: Hey 19/10/22, 10:07 pm - Simi Baruah: Missed voice call 19/10/22, 10:09 pm - Simi Baruah: 🦒 19/10/22, 10:10 pm - Simi Baruah: 🐿 here 19/10/22, 10:23 pm - Simi Baruah: Hope you feel better jaldi.

I don't want to talk to you, because i don't have anything to talk to you about. I dont think i am the right person for you to be talking to anymore. Goodluck. And Godspeed. 19/10/22, 11:49 pm - Simi Baruah: Of course you are the right person re baba. You are everything I’d hoped for and more. There are rough times in communication. We tide through with each other no. And of course samajh rahi hu at the moment baat karne ko kuch nahi hoga, kal ya parso toh hoga na. I’m game for that.

Baad mein baat karte hain 😏 20/10/22, 12:04 am - Sumit Kumar: I cannot compromise myself in talking to you anymore. I realise i cannot sweet talk my way out of this. So i have to be blunt and direct with you. I am sorry. I am sick because of it. Not being able to get my message across. You are deliberately trying to misunderstand me. I have tried in the past, you and i have different perspectives and i am not getting yours. Let me fix mine. I have this realisation we are bot seeing the same big picture here. I need to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch as my previous plans seem to be put into disorder due my inability to pay enough attention to them . I feel this relationship to be responsible partly for taking my efforts more than what was required or my capacity to commit to it. I am in my senses and health while taking this decision. I do love you, and hope for your best. But there are certain things i cannot compromise on. I guess i cannot share those things with you either. I am sorry for ever misleading or hurting you. I would miss you, but i wouldn't let myself ruin our lives by trying to get together again. I can deal with my problems but can't have anyone else looking down on me for my problems. I can not remember how to love you anymore, in a way that is acceptable by me. I cannot continue this as it is. 20/10/22, 12:06 am - Simi Baruah: You are not ruining our lives 20/10/22, 12:26 am - Sumit Kumar: Goodnight Simi. 20/10/22, 12:38 am - Simi Baruah: I’ve never been more sorry. Kaan pakadti hu I won’t do that to you again. Give me a chance 20/10/22, 12:38 am - Simi Baruah: Please Sumit 20/10/22, 12:43 am - Simi Baruah: I’ll do everything in my power to make it right. And to not repeat what happened 20/10/22, 12:44 am - Simi Baruah: Ek chance de de apna kabhi samjha ho toh. I know it sounds corny but I mean it 20/10/22, 12:44 am - Simi Baruah: Please 20/10/22, 12:58 am - Sumit Kumar: I do not want to take such liberties. This is not the right social behaviour that i am looking to promote. 20/10/22, 1:01 am - Sumit Kumar: I don't even know why it happened I thought it must be something that i did, that made it happen so. A reaction to my past action, but what i don't know. 20/10/22, 1:01 am - Simi Baruah: Missed voice call 20/10/22, 1:02 am - Simi Baruah: You didn’t do anything here. I made you my family I guess 20/10/22, 1:03 am - Simi Baruah: Take all the liberties. Just no goodbyes 20/10/22, 1:03 am - Simi Baruah: You’ve taken any such liberties don’t worry 20/10/22, 1:04 am - Simi Baruah: I gave you if ever anything happened 20/10/22, 1:39 am - Sumit Kumar: Sorry simi i need to look after myself right now. 20/10/22, 1:43 am - Sumit Kumar: You deleted this message 20/10/22, 1:45 am - Sumit Kumar: Hope you can do it too. Dont fight against the world for me, fight it for yourself. And also don't think me to be weak that i cannot face it by myself. Thanks for your help. It is appreciated. But i think i couldn't help you see my ideals or value them. I need to live by them for my sake. 20/10/22, 1:44 am - Simi Baruah: Missed voice call 20/10/22, 2:20 am - Simi Baruah: This message was deleted 20/10/22, 4:19 am - Simi Baruah: This message was deleted 20/10/22, 4:16 am - Simi Baruah: Missed voice call 20/10/22, 3:26 pm - You blocked this contact. Tap to unblock. 20/10/22, 3:31 pm - You unblocked this contact. 20/10/22, 4:41 pm - Sumit Kumar: Simi, please understand i dont want to be in a relationship. 20/10/22, 4:41 pm - Sumit Kumar: Or want to continue talking about it. 20/10/22, 4:41 pm - Sumit Kumar: All of this is giving me a constant headache. 20/10/22, 4:42 pm - Sumit Kumar: Thinking about all of this. 20/10/22, 4:43 pm - Sumit Kumar: I don't think i will ever be able to recover from whatever happened over this weekend. And it's just not this weekend. Its been a culmination of events that has led me to realise this is not what i want in life. 20/10/22, 4:43 pm - Sumit Kumar: Please realise this. 20/10/22, 4:44 pm - Sumit Kumar: You have not provided me with the understanding i deserved., I cannot make you understand either. 20/10/22, 4:44 pm - Sumit Kumar: Anymore. 20/10/22, 4:49 pm - Sumit Kumar: I cannot be a party to this behaviour. I feel disrespected and disregarded. I don't feel i have been given enough space to grow. You have taken the liberty to take those resources for yourself and given me just as much you thought you were ok with me having. It has rendered me without passion for this. I need those passions to meet my ambitions. I was able to incorporate you in all of it once. I cannot anymore. I feel you have been doing things behind my back and keeping a lot of your intentions hidden from me. I cannot be a part of something where i feel this way. 20/10/22, 4:51 pm - Sumit Kumar: Hope you understand when i don't pick up your calls or don't call you back. 20/10/22, 4:51 pm - Simi Baruah: I’ve never lied to you or hidden my intentions ever. I’ve been completely bare. Always. More with you then anyone ever 20/10/22, 4:51 pm - Simi Baruah: And you know all of this. Don’t know where all this is coming from what you’re saying. You also know it’s not true 20/10/22, 4:52 pm - Simi Baruah: Stop texting all this Sumit please. I also get anxious. 20/10/22, 4:52 pm - Simi Baruah: Call pe bolo nahi toh stop texting please 20/10/22, 4:52 pm - Sumit Kumar: Sorry Simi its a feeling that has built up over time. This weekend just triggered me into believing that you had other intentions that you didn't let me into. 20/10/22, 4:53 pm - Simi Baruah: It’s way harsher than you and I both intend to be over text. You know that. We both do 20/10/22, 4:53 pm - Sumit Kumar: No. 20/10/22, 4:53 pm - Simi Baruah: Waisa obviously nahi tha aur naahi hain 20/10/22, 4:53 pm - Simi Baruah: It is 20/10/22, 4:53 pm - Simi Baruah: Take your time and reach out when you can speak nicer. I will too 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Sumit Kumar: Simi. 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Sumit Kumar: Understand. 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Sumit Kumar: I cannot. 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Simi Baruah: without prejudice over what we did or said to each other 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Sumit Kumar: You don't speak nice to me. 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Simi Baruah: You can. We’ve always given each other that respect. At least we try to 20/10/22, 4:54 pm - Sumit Kumar: And i cannot do the same back to you either. 20/10/22, 4:55 pm - Sumit Kumar: It's not a flourishing ecosystem for me. 20/10/22, 4:55 pm - Simi Baruah: Don’t you see me try to do that every time. I’m still trying no 20/10/22, 4:55 pm - Sumit Kumar: It indeed is Toxic for the both of us. 20/10/22, 4:55 pm - Simi Baruah: It’s not toxic 20/10/22, 4:56 pm - Sumit Kumar: I guess i haven't been able to grow past the first time i had to use this phrase. 20/10/22, 4:56 pm - Sumit Kumar: Haven't been happy since. 20/10/22, 4:56 pm - Simi Baruah: You believing that it has been or is has made it so sometimes 20/10/22, 4:56 pm - Simi Baruah: That’s totally false. You know that 20/10/22, 4:57 pm - Sumit Kumar: I need to feel happiness too. Not belive or hope for it or keep faith in better times. But have better times. And sustain them without effort. 20/10/22, 4:57 pm - Sumit Kumar: Happiness shouldn't take so much effort. 20/10/22, 4:57 pm - Sumit Kumar: Nahee hoon is relationship mein happy mein. 20/10/22, 4:57 pm - Sumit Kumar: Aur nahee hora aur work ispe. 20/10/22, 4:58 pm - Sumit Kumar: Bhaag nahee raha. 20/10/22, 4:58 pm - Simi Baruah: Believe and hope are things necessary to sustain Sumit. You can have that for us too 20/10/22, 4:58 pm - Sumit Kumar: Uljhao mat cheezo ko please. 20/10/22, 4:59 pm - Simi Baruah: Mereko karne de na work. Let’s just work individually and see what the future holds for us na 20/10/22, 4:59 pm - Sumit Kumar: Pehle hee bahut kalesh hein jo solve karne hein duniya mein. 20/10/22, 4:59 pm - Sumit Kumar: I can't allow myself be a bystander in this either. 20/10/22, 4:59 pm - Simi Baruah: Toh aur kyun Kalesh badhana by ending relationship 20/10/22, 4:59 pm - Sumit Kumar: Mereko bhee khudka growth chaheeye. 20/10/22, 5:00 pm - Simi Baruah: I’m not telling you to be a bystander 20/10/22, 5:00 pm - Sumit Kumar: Nahee i want to feel used. 20/10/22, 5:00 pm - Simi Baruah: I and the relationship is not standing your growth. The mindset is 20/10/22, 5:00 pm - Sumit Kumar: I do t trust you to provide me a worry free environment. 20/10/22, 5:00 pm - Simi Baruah: ??? 20/10/22, 5:01 pm - Simi Baruah: Chup kar. Itna worry pehle nahi diya hain kabhi please 20/10/22, 5:02 pm - Sumit Kumar: The mind is set on not continuing this you are right. 20/10/22, 5:02 pm - Simi Baruah: Maine kabhi tere apologies ke baad itna bhav khaya hain kya jo tu itna kha raha hain. Accept me no please. I’ll strive to not repeat whatever happened 20/10/22, 5:03 pm - Simi Baruah: So you know that. Then don’t let that control you na 20/10/22, 5:03 pm - Sumit Kumar: Tum mujhe manipulate kar rahe ho against my intentions. 20/10/22, 5:03 pm - Sumit Kumar: Just take a No for. No. And let it be. 20/10/22, 5:03 pm - Simi Baruah: Missed video call 20/10/22, 5:04 pm - Simi Baruah: Sorry called by mistake 20/10/22, 5:04 pm - Simi Baruah: No 20/10/22, 5:04 pm - Simi Baruah: I’m not manipulating you. I’m fighting for you. 20/10/22, 5:04 pm - Sumit Kumar: I will never trust you again after what you did last Sunday. 20/10/22, 5:05 pm - Simi Baruah: Did I really do something that grave that deserves that 20/10/22, 5:05 pm - Simi Baruah: We’ve forgiven and accepted each other over worst things 20/10/22, 5:05 pm - Sumit Kumar: Sorry i cannot explain what it did or changed for me. 20/10/22, 5:05 pm - Simi Baruah: And no that was not toxic. That was growth and evolution 20/10/22, 5:05 pm - Simi Baruah: Try 20/10/22, 5:06 pm - Simi Baruah: We have both bettered ourselves before for the consequences of our past actions. Let me do the same. The same way I may have helped you kabhi pehle. 20/10/22, 5:07 pm - Sumit Kumar: Your heart is not in this anyway simi. You are in this with your brain. 20/10/22, 5:07 pm - Sumit Kumar: I cannot deal with this relationship like it 20/10/22, 5:08 pm - Sumit Kumar: And so i would protect my interest too. 20/10/22, 5:08 pm - Simi Baruah: It’s all heart Sumit. And maybe kabhi brains, the required amount I guess 20/10/22, 5:08 pm - Sumit Kumar: I have waited for you to see how i was in this with my hurt. 20/10/22, 5:08 pm - Sumit Kumar: Maybe thats why i was so protective and wanted to leave all the time. 20/10/22, 5:09 pm - Sumit Kumar: Because i didn't find the same emotion reciprocated. 20/10/22, 5:09 pm - Simi Baruah: No you were not 20/10/22, 5:10 pm - Sumit Kumar: Now it has come to the point that i am being forced to be in this without heart but just using my brain in this. 20/10/22, 5:10 pm - Sumit Kumar: I cannot accept such a relationship. 20/10/22, 5:10 pm - Simi Baruah: Are you serious. Kuch bhi mat bol. Especially about reciprocation. I’ve done more than reciprocate. I’ve not held back anything. 20/10/22, 5:11 pm - Simi Baruah: You think what you’re doing is from the brain right now, but it’s from hurt only. That’s also heart 20/10/22, 5:11 pm - Simi Baruah: Is rather that you express from both. So that you see my emotions and how I’m trying here 20/10/22, 5:12 pm - Simi Baruah: *I’d rather 20/10/22, 5:12 pm - Sumit Kumar: Mereko nahee sunana Simi. 20/10/22, 5:13 pm - Simi Baruah: Please Sumit thoda patience rakh na and let me try. Take some time to reflect. You’re only just talking from impulse and all hurt. You’re not seeing me and what I’m saying at all 20/10/22, 5:13 pm - Sumit Kumar: You just want me to waste my time on all of this. 20/10/22, 5:14 pm - Simi Baruah: Bilkul nahi dekh raha hain tu ek baar bhi mujhe all the while when you’re saying what I may have done to you 20/10/22, 5:15 pm - Simi Baruah: That’s the thing. I don’t. That’s why I’m saying take time please. I won’t disturb you okay. I also cant take so much. Reach out if and when you feel so okay 20/10/22, 5:15 pm - Sumit Kumar: I don't want to be in this position. 20/10/22, 5:15 pm - Simi Baruah: Mere se bhi nahi ho raha aise itna stress. 20/10/22, 5:16 pm - Sumit Kumar: When i have asked you to do anything like this? 20/10/22, 5:16 pm - Simi Baruah: Isliye keh rahi hu. Please dosti keh khatir thoda patience and distance le le and see na. Reach out only if you feel like okay 20/10/22, 5:16 pm - Sumit Kumar: Tum apne stresses mere pe daal kar expect kar rahe ho for me to be patient. 20/10/22, 5:16 pm - Simi Baruah: Don’t cut me off. Can’t take that 20/10/22, 5:17 pm - Simi Baruah: I’m not putting my stress on you kya bol raha hain 20/10/22, 5:17 pm - Sumit Kumar: I don't want to have you exist in my life anymore. 20/10/22, 5:17 pm - Sumit Kumar: I am ok with that. 20/10/22, 5:17 pm - Simi Baruah: I’m not 20/10/22, 5:19 pm - You blocked this contact. Tap to unblock. 20/10/22, 5:19 pm - You unblocked this contact. 20/10/22, 5:20 pm - Sumit Kumar: I should've blocked you while you were Guwahati itself and never unblocked you again. 20/10/22, 5:20 pm - You blocked this contact. Tap to unblock. 21/10/22, 12:13 am - You unblocked this contact. 21/10/22, 10:20 pm - Sumit Kumar: I am sorry for what i have said, it was the only way i could find an expression of how i was feeling. I can only imagine and respect how you kept your patience through all of that. 21/10/22, 10:23 pm - Sumit Kumar: I just felt slightly embarrassed and needed some assurances. Besides was having trust issues and in general was feeling insecure. Being tired, and weak lack of sleep and appetite compounded over several past days leading me to be short tempered and quick at response without evaluating the whole situation. This lead me to not being able to understand he whole situation and not give enough attention to your feelings. I do want to care for tthe person i am in relationship with, and not being able to do that, mad eme feel i was a changed person. Leading em to the feeling of being lost and not wanting to be in it. 21/10/22, 10:23 pm - Sumit Kumar: I do not know how to fix this. 21/10/22, 10:23 pm - Sumit Kumar: But i know it needs to be done on my end too. 21/10/22, 10:30 pm - Sumit Kumar: In general i did not want to feel like i needed someone's help. But i guess i do need it to understand and move past my insecurities. You are able to see my insecurities often, and it seems to me that you are pushing me against the wall with them. It gets me to a point where i myself might not be able to keep those in check. 21/10/22, 10:30 pm - Sumit Kumar: I do not know how to be in this relationship anymore tbh. 21/10/22, 10:31 pm - Sumit Kumar: But i do realise i need to keep a check on what i say. It just keeps getting me in trouble. 21/10/22, 10:32 pm - Sumit Kumar: But i guess i tried to listen and ssay over the course of 2 years. 21/10/22, 10:32 pm - Sumit Kumar: It just seemed like i am being heard ro rhe point of being ignored. 21/10/22, 10:32 pm - Sumit Kumar: Now. So i end up speaking more and louder. 21/10/22, 10:32 pm - Sumit Kumar: I don't know the right tact in between. 21/10/22, 10:33 pm - Sumit Kumar: Hope you had a good day. 21/10/22, 10:33 pm - Sumit Kumar: Goodnight. 21/10/22, 11:41 pm - Simi Baruah: Fuck my notifications were turned off and I didn’t see your messages. 21/10/22, 11:42 pm - Simi Baruah: Thanks for saying all this.

And you not only saw them, but faced the brunt too. I’m sorry. I’ll be better. 21/10/22, 11:47 pm - Simi Baruah: I had a thoda busy day. Overall okay tha.

I do feel better/ normal, happier even. Too much pressure to be happy/ecstatic is also not right no, will defeat the purpose. Purpose is to feel like yourself, which I am. 27/10/22, 11:49 am - Simi Baruah: Acha I’d called because phone doesn’t have much charge 27/10/22, 11:49 am - Sumit Kumar: Bakee tere pe spend karta hain matlab? 27/10/22, 11:50 am - Sumit Kumar: Haan haan not asking about your mood.

I also do the same. Can’t do more. You should feel better 😋 27/10/22, 11:57 am - Simi Baruah: You can’t always make me ekdom too happy also na, the same way I can’t. Kuch cheeze hain aisi that I need to do to do for myself. You did your job by making me feel better about myself and in general about things, and by giving me the motivation and strength to do all that. Baaki let me take charge no. 27/10/22, 11:57 am - Simi Baruah: Your reaction 🤦🏻‍♀️😂 27/10/22, 11:58 am - Simi Baruah: I know you agree. 27/10/22, 11:58 am - Sumit Kumar: I am not trying to make you too happy simi.

Main bhi bohot gusse main bol deti hu too much in response. I’m sorry. Yes I know you show that side sometimes, but you’re also trying I know to always be the man you know you are truly. You’ve failed sometimes but you’ve succeeded many more times. I shouldn’t fail to tell you that(which I do forget when things get too heated). You are more than those trying times. I fail you too when I fail to mention your strengths and rather see only your weaknesses in these times. I’m sorry. Thanks for your message. You are sweet 🤍 07/01/23, 2:53 am - Sumit Kumar: Koi baat nahee. Don't worry. I'll block you in my own time. I think that's what you expected me to do last night. I am apologetic for not having it in me to do that earlier. Would've spared the both of us from having to resort to Shaming each other.
