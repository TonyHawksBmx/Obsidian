I don't think you deserve to be with me, while i cannot respect your emotions. I cannot be the cause of getting you to a place from where it will be hard to recover from. You are a good person simi. And I didn't think anybody had to become the bad person in this. I was really hoping i could use this time to recover from all that was going on before, and come back rejuvenated. I didn't hope to have to resort to this. I really was not hoping you would get into a fight for attention. I am sorry if it hurts you now. It will heal soon. I hope. 10/18/21, 7:24 PM - Sumit Kumar: I'd rather be with someone who i do not have to say to tell what i want but who can understand what i want. You are not that, and I'd rather fond them. 10/18/21, 7:24 PM - Sumit Kumar: *find 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I hope you get better too. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am at peace with all things. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Your empathy is not needed. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its what troubles me. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And i understand that you cannot change that 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Thus i had to step away. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I know everytime you say we can talk or chat. It will end up with me being in a place of discomfort. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And i will disregard it to make you feel comfortable. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But it isn't fair on myself. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I have made myself clear on that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I guess you are good in that. You will find someone who likes those qualities in you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Good luck. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am not perfect and you didn't allow enough space for me to change myself into being better. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Maybe you were to involved in your self interest. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You kept your emotions bottled up for the last stand. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its what i understood you were keeping. But it kept me in a turmoil. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Had i not done something like that, i wouldn't have had felt or understood what you were keeping. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Anywho. Sorry for not understanding you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: It had meant that you may have haad needed to prove yourself that i am not the right person. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I think you are at peace with it now. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I really cannot deal with you anymore. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And am sure neither can you 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Yes that gif was too much for the conversation. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You have kept your emotions and mine. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And i cant have an affect on that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: It was not a simple reaction to the miss yous. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I had been saying that to you. You were less expressive/ or not expressing you emotions in the way that i could reciprocate to them. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: So naturally when you decided to suddenly say 'i love you' the day before you knew i was going. Or send me miss you. When you knew i was unavailable may seem a little upsetting. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But i am done with this. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I know you feel i have wronged you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its natural to overlook ones own mistakes. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I can just say, when you do realise what wrong it was. That i do not hold it against you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: For i know i have done many wrongs. And i apologise for the day you realise those wrongs hurt you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You may be overlooking them now, but they are there. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: The reason i cannot keep this up. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: It was not me who needed the space simi 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I know what i feel and have been expressive enough of it. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You did not 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You were maybe really just using me for the boredom part. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: As i was shayad too. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Now you did entice me into a conversation which i was trying to avoid. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But i will deal with it. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: This is my last conversation with you. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I really have to say this. So you do understand things can never be the same as they were .. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its difficult but it is needed. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You jave used my emotions to better understand yours. And it hurt me that you did that without my permmission 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Empathy is something that did not work for me, for it kept you from "really" understanding me. And frustrated me to the point where i couldn't explain you my emotions. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Anyway. I'll leave now. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Just two more things. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its too coomplicated. But what i meant was just for this instant. This being... 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: This. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I was taking stock of my emotions. Taking my time to respond to this. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But you did not then. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And got me involved in the conversation. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Which led to this. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I cannot just let go of that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You may speak that you will change after that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But the fact that you did not do it then. May be a ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜œ to you. But it was ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤•ðŸ¤’ to me. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I guess you understand the language of emoticons better. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Wait. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: What i said then was only after having a conversation with you. And you said you understand. And post that you had all your doubts. Which i really couldn't explain then. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: . 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: IMG-20211018-WA0015.jpg (file attached) 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: We could've had worked past the "i am not closed to the idea" 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And thats what i meant when i said we couldve had figurred that out 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am not keeping you from expressing things. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Dont think ot was wrong of you to do that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I do not wish to say or do something that gives you the wrong experience. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Or idea. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Please dont try to be condescending or patronising to my emotions. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I may have done that to you. My apologies. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am sorry you felt that. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You did not. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: It wasn't a goal or something that i was setting for myself. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I dont know simi.

And i know you were hoping to do it too. Maybe your inability to deal with your insecurities were caused by my own. And they wouldve eventually become each others insecurities. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I could already feel yours. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Chalo then.

You kept waiting for a promise to hang on to, without being comfortable yourself. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: You dug that hole for yourself, and i fell into it. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: I kept falling in to it, for you even before. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But all i needed was this time to myself. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: And i do appreciate you for all the times you did understand me. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: But it was not unconditional. 10/18/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its not about all the times we understood each other, but about the times when we did not. 10/19/21, 8:46 AM - Sumit Kumar: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-action-plan-environment-act-birth-certificate-citizenship-jobs-clause-ftas-7578973/ Shared by Indian Express android app Click here to download play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indianexpress.android!
