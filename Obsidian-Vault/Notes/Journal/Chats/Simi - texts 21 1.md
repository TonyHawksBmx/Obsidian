In my message, I mentioned about trying to shrug it off every time as nothing. It happened on its own. I never tried to do that. 10/16/21, 11:48 PM - Simi Raus: I hope you give a call/message/ meet when you’re back. I’m leaving that open for you ‘cause I have a feeling that I need to/should so that you can if/when you want to. 10/16/21, 11:48 PM - Simi Raus: Waiting for this message 10/16/21, 11:49 PM - Simi Raus: I have that feeling. Wasn’t trying deliberately 10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: You can give a call when you can or take one of my calls or do a call back. I would like that. A break up/such conversation over text is how you know. Respect my feelings over here thoda. We’ve given each other enough time amid energy to warrant that at least I think don’t you think. 10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: I’ll be waiting for a call. Good night. Sleep well. 10/16/21, 11:51 PM - Simi Raus: 🌷 10/16/21, 11:52 PM - Simi Raus: Please don’t be mean or sound so mean like that. It hurts you know. I’m human. And then later you also hurt/feel guilty knowing how it hurt me. 10/16/21, 11:56 PM - Simi Raus: I’ve learnt from the past here. So I’m doing that :) 10/16/21, 11:58 PM - Simi Raus: Don’t talk like you hate/dislike me when you don’t. It can really do a number on the other person you know. It’s the shittiest feeling. 10/16/21, 11:58 PM - Simi Raus: Anyway goodnight. Hoping to hear from you. I mean it 🌹 10/17/21, 4:08 AM - Simi Raus: Don’t blame me when I didn’t try to do anything. I can’t control something like my intuition like that. I had no control over it. 10/17/21, 4:19 AM - Simi Raus: That cannot be the reason 10/17/21, 4:24 AM - Simi Raus: Please sometimes try to understand my side and feelings a little also. Don’t just readily put blame like that. That’s just…. 10/17/21, 4:46 AM - Simi Raus: Is it really that easy for you to say that? 10/17/21, 5:07 AM - Simi Raus: The things you say to be sometimes, they’re way too harsh. Do they come that easy to you kya without any consideration of how I could feel. Do I deserve no regard for my feelings? 10/17/21, 5:09 AM - Simi Raus: or just in general any kind of regard in your life? 10/17/21, 11:17 AM - Simi Raus: Like you don’t care kya how any of this I’m handling or how I could feel. Don’t you feel like even checking up? 10/17/21, 11:17 AM - Simi Raus: I’m sincerely not trying to get you angry or riled up. It’s just difficult to process I’m sorry 10/17/21, 11:23 AM - Simi Raus: Would feel really nice to me. 10/17/21, 11:54 AM - Simi Raus: I can’t just shut you out aggressively like this Sumit. Somewhere I genuinely feel that I shouldn’t, that I should keep lines of communication open still. I’m doing that. For the sake of the happy times last month that we spent with each other. That deserves better than a text thread and such messages. Please Sumit I’ve always considered and being patient with your feelings and emotions and wants, couldn’t you be once. I know you are not trying to be rude, and that trying things are going on at your end, but somewhere you know what I’m saying has truth to it. Please reach out(must’ve said that a 100 times by now I think. Please don’t make be beg like I have no shame at all) ❤️ 10/17/21, 12:09 PM - Simi Raus: I would really like to talk to you and see you when I can ♥️ 10/17/21, 12:18 PM - Simi Raus: I know you care even when you seemed like you don’t. But it’s just hard to see that side. I hope you understand that 🌻 10/18/21, 1:27 AM - Simi Raus: I really miss you 🤍 10/18/21, 6:50 PM - Sumit Kumar: Let someone love/miss you for who you are, and do not do things to make them love/miss you. It pains me to know if this is hurting you, but i really have to be involved elsewhere abhee. I hope you do not make me worry for you any more than you have to. 10/18/21, 6:51 PM - Sumit Kumar: Good luck. And i do care for your well being. But not more than you do for your own. 10/18/21, 7:01 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am sorry for making you have to wait for my text. I was hoping we could hold the conversation till the time i was not busy. Or that you could understand it. I can understand the pain you may have been facing, having had to face it myself. I wish for you to have an easier access to the medicine than i had. 10/18/21, 7:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: I do not have the texts between the two texts below. 10/18/21, 7:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: . 10/18/21, 7:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: . 10/18/21, 7:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: If you can send me the missing texts it would be good.

But later. I meant whenever. 10/18/21, 7:05 PM - Simi Raus: What wtf?

That’s all I’m asking for, I.e, a confirmation of a call when you’re a little free. 10/18/21, 7:13 PM - Sumit Kumar: But you are unintentionally. Cause your desire. 10/18/21, 7:15 PM - Simi Raus: Sumit I’m not/wasn’t a random girl in your life. You owe a phone conversation at least over a ‘break up text’. We’ve been through enough together. Especially the past month and the moments…. 10/18/21, 7:15 PM - Sumit Kumar: I did not ask you to get depended on my call like that. I did give you a call before i sent a message. 10/18/21, 7:15 PM - Sumit Kumar: You just want a fight. 10/18/21, 7:16 PM - Simi Raus: That a very different phone call and subsequent message. You talked about meeting me and happy things. 10/18/21, 7:16 PM - Sumit Kumar: I can/will give you that. If that is what you want? 10/18/21, 7:16 PM - Sumit Kumar: But not at present. 10/18/21, 7:16 PM - Simi Raus: That’s gaslighting. I don’t want a fight. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Sumit Kumar: Goodbye simi. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Simi Raus: Okay I’m fine with that. I just wanted a simple answer. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Sumit Kumar: You are troubling me now. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Simi Raus: Sumit please don’t say such things. I don’t use/say such things to you ever. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Sumit Kumar: I may have caused it on myself. But you could not help me avert this. 10/18/21, 7:17 PM - Sumit Kumar: *did not 10/18/21, 7:18 PM - Sumit Kumar: I allowed for me to take all the blame, for you couldn't see it in yourself. 10/18/21, 7:18 PM - Sumit Kumar: We could've had fixed it had you been patient with my emotions. 10/18/21, 7:18 PM - Simi Raus: I tried to help Sumit. I’d been patient ans there whenever you needed for quite some time now. 10/18/21, 7:18 PM - Sumit Kumar: But you only though you were being that. 10/18/21, 7:19 PM - Sumit Kumar: While you expected me to be with yours. 10/18/21, 7:20 PM - Sumit Kumar: If you have anything to say, say it. I cannot apeak anything now. 10/18/21, 7:20 PM - Simi Raus: I am baba. I want to fix it together. I only wanted us to talk when you’re thoda less occupied with things. Trust me on that. And that’s what I’ve been asking for this whole time. Whenever you’re free/back let’s talk peacefully. But you were why replying to any of those and I got really confused and anxious. I’m sorry 10/18/21, 7:20 PM - Sumit Kumar: *write 10/18/21, 7:22 PM - Simi Raus: You know I try to be always. This time I couldn’t read between your texts Sumit. And then your phone was off for so long. I didn’t know what to do. 10/18/21, 7:22 PM - Simi Raus: I can be patient. If you just say so. I promise 10/18/21, 7:24 PM - Simi Raus: You were also saying things otherwise. Had yiu just said, “Simi, be patient. Let me sort my things out and we’ll aaraam se when I’m free or back or when I contact you. I’m preoccupied abhi”. Something like that. I would never bug you tab. I would’ve understood clearly. 🌻 10/18/21, 7:25 PM - Simi Raus: *aaraam se talk 10/18/21, 7:26 PM - Simi Raus: I care for you and your emotions more than you know. Really. I would’ve never knowingly made it worse for you. I would be patient. 🤍 10/18/21, 7:27 PM - Simi Raus: Sorry I didn’t see the SMS.

Dictionary says, ‘period’. 10/18/21, 7:29 PM - Simi Raus: 😅 10/18/21, 7:32 PM - Sumit Kumar: . I do not have the messages before this. My whatsapp glitched. I am waiting for backup to retrieve chat. Can you send what i had said ? 10/18/21, 7:34 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:34 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:35 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:35 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:36 PM - Sumit Kumar: Before. 10/18/21, 7:36 PM - Simi Raus: Yeah your security code changed 3 times 10/18/21, 7:36 PM - Simi Raus: How long before? 10/18/21, 7:37 PM - Sumit Kumar: I couldn't keep up with this conversation. 10/18/21, 7:37 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:38 PM - Simi Raus: <Media omitted> 10/18/21, 7:39 PM - Simi Raus: Should be fine? 10/18/21, 7:39 PM - Sumit Kumar: Yes. 10/18/21, 7:39 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am running low on battery and have to go, you had anything to say? 10/18/21, 7:40 PM - Simi Raus: Nothing really. I can wait when your in the mood/free/back. Theek hain kya woh? 10/18/21, 7:41 PM - Sumit Kumar: Sorry I didn't understand the second part of you message? 10/18/21, 7:42 PM - Simi Raus: I said I can wait to talk when you feel like talking to me- when you’re free or when you’re back. Woh theek hain kya? 10/18/21, 7:42 PM - Simi Raus: Talk matlab any talk. 10/18/21, 7:42 PM - Sumit Kumar: I still dont understand the second part. I.e the second sentence. 10/18/21, 7:43 PM - Simi Raus: “Woh theek hain kya”? 10/18/21, 7:43 PM - Sumit Kumar: Wdym? 10/18/21, 7:43 PM - Simi Raus: Matlab that line you don’t understand? 10/18/21, 7:44 PM - Sumit Kumar: Simi what do you want? 10/18/21, 7:46 PM - Simi Raus: I want to have a nice conversation with you when you’re available to talk with me. It can be about anything. We don’t have to talk about all this if you’re don’t want to. That my way of saying I’m capable of being patient/understanding with your emotions. I’m up for it. I didn’t realise you felt that way. 10/18/21, 7:47 PM - Simi Raus: That I wasn’t being patient with your emotions. 10/18/21, 7:47 PM - Sumit Kumar: I haave to go now. 10/18/21, 7:48 PM - Sumit Kumar: I don't think it would work like that. 10/18/21, 7:49 PM - Sumit Kumar: I have said all i had to say. Really. 10/18/21, 7:51 PM - Simi Raus: But yiu said that I said being considerate/caring enough of your emotions and asking too many questions. And that we could’ve fixed it had I being patient and questioned things less and waited for sometime. 10/18/21, 7:51 PM - Simi Raus: So I’m saying I’ll be patient and ask less for now. 10/18/21, 7:51 PM - Simi Raus: *I wasn’t being 10/18/21, 7:51 PM - Sumit Kumar: No simi. 10/18/21, 7:51 PM - Sumit Kumar: Classic manipulating. That second line. 10/18/21, 7:52 PM - Sumit Kumar: I wouldn't ever do that 10/18/21, 7:52 PM - Sumit Kumar: You did. 10/18/21, 7:52 PM - Simi Raus: What?? Wow Sumit. 10/18/21, 7:53 PM - Sumit Kumar: Are you comfortable knowing that we may never not talk again.? 10/18/21, 7:54 PM - Simi Raus: Yiu said we could’ve fixed things after making me feel so anxious and agitated with your ‘farewell’ texts and other things. One day talking about meeting later and complimenting me about things and next day about breaking up and that I was manipulative. and you’re saying that I was being manipulative 10/18/21, 7:54 PM - Sumit Kumar: I cannot fight with you. 10/18/21, 7:54 PM - Sumit Kumar: Anymore. 10/18/21, 7:54 PM - Sumit Kumar: Or discuss with you anything. 10/18/21, 7:55 PM - Simi Raus: I don’t want to. You started with me being manipulative. That’s gaslighting Sumit. 10/18/21, 7:55 PM - Sumit Kumar: I am not writing anymore. 10/18/21, 7:55 PM - Simi Raus: I’m not 10/18/21, 7:55 PM - Sumit Kumar: You never explained this part. 10/18/21, 7:55 PM - Sumit Kumar: We both know who os doing what. 10/18/21, 7:56 PM - Sumit Kumar: Unless you have others involved. 10/18/21, 7:56 PM - Simi Raus: It means ‘is that fine’. It was the question to my line which yiu said was ‘Classic manipulation’. 10/18/21, 7:56 PM - Sumit Kumar: I waited enough for an explanation. 10/18/21, 7:56 PM - Simi Raus: Sumit that’s too far. 10/18/21, 7:57 PM - Simi Raus: Are you calling me a whore/class A manipulator of some sort? 10/18/21, 7:57 PM - Sumit Kumar: Chalo thanks for understanding/not understanding whatever my situation. 10/18/21, 7:58 PM - Simi Raus: What did you mean by that? 10/18/21, 7:59 PM - Simi Raus: I have patiently explained and sent screenshots of texts yiu asked for. 10/18/21, 7:59 PM - Simi Raus: So I’m asking what did you mean by that line? 10/18/21, 8:00 PM - Sumit Kumar: I do think you are a good person. But you wont be with me. I cannot deala with this right now. 10/18/21, 8:00 PM - Sumit Kumar: You couldve explained me. 10/18/21, 8:00 PM - Sumit Kumar: Its these small things, which keep me from seeing the bigger picture with you. 10/18/21, 8:00 PM - Simi Raus: I did! 10/18/21, 8:01 PM - Sumit Kumar: I cannot keep ignoring this 10/18/21, 8:01 PM - Sumit Kumar: Maybe we DONT actually understand each other. 10/18/21, 8:01 PM - Simi Raus: This! 10/18/21, 8:01 PM - Sumit Kumar: You did not understand what the second part was. 10/18/21, 8:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: I do not know what's gone wrong, but there is something that isn't right in this. I don't think you deserve to be with me, while i cannot respect your emotions. I cannot be the cause of getting you to a place from where it will be hard to recover from. You are a good person simi. And I didn't think anybody had to become the bad person in this. I was really hoping i could use this time to recover from all that was going on before, and come back rejuvenated. I didn't hope to have to resort to this. I really was not hoping you would get into a fight for attention. I am sorry if it hurts you now. It will heal soon. I hope. 10/18/21, 8:02 PM - Simi Raus: Sumit you’re not even trying. Yiu just see me not understanding something like this conversation and you blame everything. That’s but fair no. Don’t you see 10/18/21, 8:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: I'd rather be with someone who i do not have to say to tell what i want but who can understand what i want. You are not that, and I'd rather find them. 10/18/21, 8:02 PM - Sumit Kumar: I will go now. 10/18/21, 8:49 PM - Sumit Kumar: . 10/18/21, 8:49 PM - Sumit Kumar: . 10/18/21, 8:06 PM - Simi Raus: “I was really hoping i could use this time to recover from all that was going on before, and come back rejuvenated. “ - That’s why I was giving you space Gandu! Wasn’t messaging/calling you randomly/incessantly(even after you said I could). One small honest/non manipulative/ weak moment ‘miss you’ I sent and this happens?! 10/18/21, 8:10 PM - Simi Raus: I wasn’t seeking attention. Just wanted to say that I was thinking of you and missing you. If that’s called attention seeking than maybe everyone is just that. I just wanted to feel good about the fact that I think of yiu evey now and then, that you weren’t some boredom ka ilaaj or replaceable with anything. Don’t call that attention seeking please. It’s an innocent man motion. Don’t taint it. People call it romantic and sweet. 10/18/21, 8:11 PM - Simi Raus: How can You get so riled up with the ‘miss you’ text Sumit? I would’ve never thought. Main kuch bhi acha sa keh nahi sakti kya tumhe. 10/18/21, 8:11 PM - Simi Raus: I’m not fighting. I’m just feeling so horribly misunderstood right now it’s painful. 10/18/21, 8:16 PM - Simi Raus: This message was deleted 10/18/21, 8:24 PM - Simi Raus: You decided to break up with me because I sent you an innocent ‘miss you’ text that got you annoyed. You could’ve just said so. Which you later did and I understood also that it’ll make you feel obligated to reply which will break your goal of not texting while you’re there. But you still didn’t leave the issue after I understood and apolized. It was so silly of an issue. Uske baad bhi after you only decided that you needed the time to rejuvenate you only texted saying ‘it’s not working out’(which would obviously warrant a reply from me). Now you say that we could’ve fixed things though that I being patient and not reacted at all. Kaise? Am I not suppose to react like a human being also kya? When you saw me being anxious also you could’ve just said ek baar bas ek baar ki we’ll talk sometime later. Would’ve been helpful and worked instantly. But you werent saying that. When you wanted the time to rejuvenate and not get bothered by texts/calls when you’re away then you shouldn’t have started a conversation right. Even like that day about reading Twilight; you only sent the photo and then you only got annoyed by a reply from me. Aise thode e chalta hain. 10/18/21, 8:25 PM - Simi Raus: On top that you keep calling me attention seeking and manipulative. You remember you much the word ‘overthinking’ hurt/annoyed you 10/18/21, 8:26 PM - Simi Raus: Now I also don’t want to keep texting it’s so exhausting. Im not even a texter. Was again only making you comfortable because you prefer it over a call. Phir bhi main hi buri and main hi all things nasty. 10/18/21, 8:30 PM - Simi Raus: You come and leave whenever you feel na. Tumhe text karna hain call nahi. Yiu can call me whatever you want and I have to be okay with it but I can’t say anything or you’ll leave the chat or cut the call or leave the relationship because ‘I’m not understanding of small things’. 10/18/21, 8:31 PM - Simi Raus: That’s why I wasn’t bothering you na Sumit. Yiu needed a break from your life in Delhi I got it. 10/18/21, 8:33 PM - Simi Raus: But yiu also see na baba you did get me riled up with those texts. You have to take responsibility for that na. Imagine yourself in my shoes and your actions. 10/18/21, 8:33 PM - Simi Raus: I’m trying to do that. 10/18/21, 8:35 PM - Simi Raus: Also yahi karne hi jab try karti hu ya karti nahi hu you say that’s it’s not right. That telepathically understanding without having to say thing. What am I suppose to do. 10/18/21, 8:35 PM - Simi Raus: Don’t answer that. I’m just saying ki aisa hain situation. 10/18/21, 8:37 PM - Simi Raus: I can understand. you’ve said before that things sometimes things get very muddled up in your head regarding me and things I say or do, even when you feel down know later that what I mean or at least that I mean no malice or had any ill thought. 10/18/21, 8:44 PM - Simi Raus: Main try kar rahi to understand you better and more sincerely without getting selfish. I think I do thoda now. But phir bhi slip ho jaati hain sometimes(maybe lot of times). I’m trying to do better. Please be patient and not take rushed steps. I’ve been trying to do the same. I genuinely feel you’re worth every effort I’ve put. Even right now when its getting difficult on my end also. Even right now. 10/18/21, 8:44 PM - Simi Raus: ♥️ 10/18/21, 8:45 PM - Simi Raus: I care enough to text. That should say a lot. 10/18/21, 8:46 PM - Simi Raus: Please don’t say I’m manipulating and seeking attention. Aisa nahi hain. I’ll seriously burst out crying like a mad doggo 😭😭😭😭😭 10/18/21, 8:46 PM - Simi Raus: This message was deleted 10/18/21, 8:47 PM - Simi Raus: Okay maybe that there is me seeking to bring attention to the fact I can still be easy going with yiu 🤪 10/18/21, 8:48 PM - Simi Raus: And I can understand that yiu still need time to heal from the past and this too. 🙃🌻 10/18/21, 8:50 PM - Simi Raus: I’m sincerely(cross my heart and hope to die) sorry Sumit for the way you could be feeling.
