By 15th march revival of chats and texts, taking time.

  

Lockdown. By 22nd chats and texts continued

By april 27th when lockdown started kicking in, ideas left unfinished. Irritable. Took the plunge by loosing my calm and getting into a tiff.

Being distant didnt help in getting the peace of mind.

  

May and june were exhausting with no studies taking place loosig the groove of studying and blaming it on the failed relationship taking up the headspace.

  

Them moving to their homeplace. Making me want to end the relation. Hoping it would bring a better sense of what was going on in my head.

  

Unsolved even after unlock and the break. Continued with the hiatus.

  

Travelling with friends over indulgence into their lives to get a better sense of things.

August also went by without mich studies. Resumption of some study.

September saw more studying. With frequent travel to friends for study and feeling much at ease.

  

October exam.

Before and after exam some talks resumed.

Feeling better without the talks and complications.

  

October and november saw complications with the morality of actions being the topic of idea in head.

  

Felt better after clearing my head of the clutter. On nov 15
