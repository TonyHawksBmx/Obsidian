# The "boiling frog effect" 
	if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will immediately jump out to escape the danger. However, if the frog is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it won't perceive the gradual increase in temperature and will eventually be boiled alive.

	"Anu and Enlil, the great gods, have decreed.
	The earth trembles.
	The mighty Anu speaks to the heavens.
	From the waters, fate is decided.
	The land is scorched, the people cry.
	In the temple, offerings are made to appease the gods.
	The storms will pass, and the order restored."
