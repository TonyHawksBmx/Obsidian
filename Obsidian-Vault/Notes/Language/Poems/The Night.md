the night is cold the night is sad for some
the night is so dark
the night come and go like my love for you
the night is time for me to sleep and dream of you
the night is everywhere I go
the night is time for some people to have fun
the night is so alone for me
i hate the night because it reminds me of you
the night was when we had fun
the night is so alone now
the night is what you love
but now the night is what i hate because of you
