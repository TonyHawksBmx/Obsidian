Sweetheart,

On this day ,when everyone listens too their heart speak.
With the doors of vanity,pride and arrogance,shut ever soo tightly,
with only red in the air,
i can hear but one name ...........................that of my princess.
everytime u make me smile ,
with those sweet talks of urs,
u make my heart skip a beat,
everytime u make me scuffle,
with those adamant gestures ,
u make my heart skip a beat,
everytime u soo coyly,
push my lips away,
u make my heart skip a beat,
everytime with coquetry,
u ask me too take u in my arms,
u make my heart beat a skip,
everytime u canoodle me soo lovingly,
my head lying in ur lap,
u make my heart skip a beat,
but all this skips are worth ,
for when the moment comes,
with ur self entwined with me like an ivy,
ur honey petals locked beneath mine,
ur buttery self melting within my grasp,
ur eyes shying away soo coyly,
ur bosom heaving against me,
ur heartbeat rhyming with mine,
these moments are worth for all those skips,
these moments are worth too make my heart stop beating...........
if only these moments never passed away.
Happy valentine day honey.
