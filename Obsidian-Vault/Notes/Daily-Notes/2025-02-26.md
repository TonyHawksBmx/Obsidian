Happy MahaShivratri!
Today was a rather ordinary day. Knowing that it was festival day, I overslept. 
My mother woke me up and asked whether i would accompany her to the local Temple.
I was unsure whether to attend the proceedings or not, but I agreed as I would not have the luxury to witness it forever and with learned experience I have learnt to not say no to my mother.

We went to the Temple at around 12:30 and returned by 1:30. It was a rather quick affair.

I came back and went to buy fruits for my mother, as she was fasting.
In the evening made Jhal-muri.
Had Food.

I took backups for my Documents online.
