Using logic, is it more logical that god exists or not?

argument is as follows:

There is no evidence for a god (at least none that has been presented to me that is in any way remotely convincing).

The “God hypothesis” (that there exists an omnipotent and omniscient being) is demonstrably “Unfalsifiable”.

There are an infinite number of unfalsifiable hypotheses for which there is no evidence (eg Russell's teapot).

There are only a finite number of unfalsifiable ideas for which evidence has been found and are therefore known to be true (eg The Black Swan Hypothesis).

In situations where evidence is lacking - yet a decision must be made one way or the other, we fall back on “Occam's razor”…which isn’t a rule of logic - but as a guiding principle turns out to be true much more often than not. It says: “When presented with competing hypothetical answers to a problem, one should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions.”

Since science can now explain the entirety of the universe without the need for there to be supernatural intervention - the hypothetical with fewest assumptions is “There is no God”.

Hence it is reasonable (if not 100% logical) to assume that there is no God until such time as evidence can be found.

Applying this same argument is why most people reject the idea that there is a Tooth Fairy, a Loch Ness Monster or Santa Claus.

It is illogical to carve out a special niche for the God Hypothesis when we reject unfalsifiable hypotheses using Occam’s Razor in all other circumstances
